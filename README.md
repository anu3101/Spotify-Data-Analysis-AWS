# Spotify-Data-Analysis-AWS

# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Spotify 2023 albums tracks and artists data. The analysis involves storing the data in AWS S3, performing Spark ETL operations using AWS Glue and Snowflake, querying the data in Snowflake, and creating visualizations in Power BI. <br>

# Tools and Technologies
**AWS S3**: Data Storage for raw and processed data. <br>
**AWS Glue**: ETL service to transform and prepare data. <br>
**Snowflake**: Data Transformation and SQL Queries. <br>
**Snowflake ODBC**: Connecting Snowflake Warehouse with Power BI. <BR>
**Power BI**: Building Visualization for optimising data understanding and reporting. <br>

# Outcomes Analysis:

The project provides insights into Spotify 2023 global data across different countries. <br>
Using AWS services ensures the solution is scalable and can handle large volumes of data i.e 400000 Tracks data. <br>
The ETL process is automated using AWS Glue and Snowflake, reducing manual effort and potential errors. <br>
Power BI enables the creation of interactive dashboards, making it easier to explore and share insights and demonstrates a robust end-to-end data pipeline using AWS services, from data collection and storage to transformation, analysis, and visualization. <br>
